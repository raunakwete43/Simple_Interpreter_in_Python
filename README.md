# Custom Language Interpreter

Welcome to the Custom Language Interpreter project! This project aims to create an interpreter for a custom programming language from scratch using Python.

## Overview

The Custom Language Interpreter is being developed to provide a platform for executing programs written in a custom programming language. The interpreter will parse, interpret, and execute code written in this language, allowing users to write programs and run them within the interpreter environment.

## Features

- Lexer: Tokenizes input code into a stream of tokens.
- Parser: Parses the token stream into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- Interpreter: Evaluates the AST and executes the corresponding actions.
- REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop): Provides an interactive shell for users to enter and execute code line by line.
- Error Handling: Detects and reports syntax and runtime errors gracefully.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Custom Language Interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```

git clone https://github.com/raunakwete43/Simple_Interpreter_in_Python

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```

cd src

```

3. Run the interpreter:

```

python shell.py

```

This will start the REPL, allowing you to enter and execute code written in the custom language.

## Usage

The interpreter supports basic operations, control structures, and function definitions. Refer to the language specification document for details on syntax and semantics.

Here's an example of using the interpreter:

```

> 5 + 3
> 4 \* (4 // 3) + 7 / 4

```
